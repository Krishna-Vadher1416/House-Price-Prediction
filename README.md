📌 Project Overview

This project predicts house prices using Machine Learning regression techniques.
Two implementations are included to demonstrate how ML workflows adapt to different datasets:

• Model trained on Scikit-learn built-in dataset
• Model trained on real-world Excel dataset

The project focuses on data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and persistence.
